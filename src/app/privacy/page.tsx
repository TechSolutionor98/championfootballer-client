        This Cookie Policy explains how Champion Footballer uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you
        when you visit our websites at{" "}
        <a href="https://championfootballer.com/" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">
          https://championfootballer.com
        </a>
        , ("<strong>Websites</strong>"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your
        rights to control our use of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases we may use cookies to collect personal information, or that becomes personal information if we
        combine it with other information.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What are cookies?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.
        Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently,
        as well as to provide reporting information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Champion Footballer) are called "first party cookies". Cookies
        set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable third
        party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive
        content and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer both when
        it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Why do we use cookies?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We use first and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in
        order for our Websites to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other
        cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Online
        Properties. Third parties serve cookies through our Websites for advertising, analytics and other purposes.
        This is described in more detail below.
      </p>
      <p>
        The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform
        are described below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific Online
        Properties you visit):
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How can I control cookies?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie rights by
        setting your preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select which
        categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly
        necessary to provide you with services.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and on our website. If you choose to reject
        cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may
        be restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. As the means
        by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should
        visit your browser's help menu for more information.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of targeted advertising. If you would like
        to find out more information, please visit{" "}

      <p>
        The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform
        are described in the table below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the
        specific Online Properties you visit):

        </strong>
        <strong>Essential website cookies:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our Websites and to use
        some of its features, such as access to secure areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar
        technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These
        are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited
        our Websites or opened an e-mail including them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns
        of users from one page within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand
        whether you have come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to
        improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns. In many instances, these
        technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their
        functioning.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local Shared Objects or "LSOs") to, among other
        things, collect and store information about your use of our services, fraud prevention and for other site
        operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to
        block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the{" "}
        <a
          href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html#_blank"

        and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete
        existing Flash Cookies (referred to "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from
        being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash
        Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or
        impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in
        connection with our services or online content.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Do you serve targeted advertising?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our Websites.
        These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant
        advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in. They may also employ technology that is
        used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. This can be accomplished by them using cookies or web
        beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide relevant
        advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. The information collected through this
        process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other details that directly
        identify you unless you choose to provide these.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How often will you update this Cookie Policy?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we
        use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy
        regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.
